1. Introduction

This project implements a CLI-based trading bot for Binance USDT-M Futures.
The bot supports Market and Limit orders along with advanced strategies such as OCO and TWAP.
The focus is on modular design, input validation, and structured logging.

2. Project Architecture

The system follows a modular structure, with each order type implemented as a separate Python module.
A centralized logger is used to ensure consistent logging across all modules.

3. Implemented Features

Market Order
Executes instantly at market price
Validates inputs
Logs execution

Command:
python src/market_orders.py BTCUSDT BUY 0.01

4.Limit Order

Logs order placement

Command:
python src/limit_orders.py BTCUSDT SELL 0.01 45000

5.OCO Order
OCO places take-profit and stop-loss orders simultaneously.
When one executes, the other is cancelled.

Command:
python src/advanced/oco.py BTCUSDT SELL 0.01 45000 38000

6.TWAP Order
TWAP splits a large order into multiple smaller orders executed at fixed intervals to reduce market impact.

Command:
python src/advanced/twap.py BTCUSDT BUY 1 5 2

7.Validation & Logging
All inputs are validated before execution
A centralized logging system records:
Order execution
Errors
Logs are stored in bot.log with timestamps

8.API Mode
The bot runs in mock mode for safety.
It can be easily connected to Binance Futures API or Testnet by replacing mock logic and adding API keys.

9.Conclusion
This project demonstrates a clean and extensible approach to building automated trading systems.
Advanced order strategies and structured logging improve reliability and maintainability.
